# Differ Helper

An AutoHotkey GUI shortcut for your preferred differ.

I mainly use it to leverage IntelliJ IDEA's powerful differ to quickly diff files or folders.


## Demo

Drop files into the GUI (or locate them using the _Browse..._ buttons) and click _Compare_.

## Installation and usage

1. Set the full command of your preferred differ in **Differ Helper.ini**

2. Run **Differ Helper.exe**

Or, if you want to modify it, edit **Differ Helper.ahk** and run **Compile.ahk** to create an executable ([AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) must be installed to compile).
